👊 Melee Knockout – Players fall unconscious if hit with fists and drop below a configurable health threshold.

🧠 Unconscious State – Plays a looping animation while disabling movement, combat, and vehicle controls.

⏳ ox_lib Progress Bar – Shows a timer during unconsciousness; fully configurable through Config.
